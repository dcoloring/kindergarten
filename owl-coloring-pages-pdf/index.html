Owls typically have feathers of the same colors as their environment, so a barn owl differs from a great horned owl. Owls are birds from the order strigiformes, which includes over 200 species of mostly solitary and nocturnal birds of prey typified by an upright stance, a large, broad head, binocular vision, binaural hearing, sharp talons, and feathers adapted for silent flight. Like all printable coloring pages on the artisan life, these are for personal and single classroom use. Most often, a barn owl is portrayed on an owl coloring page.
